# 1.Introduction

### 1.0 Computer Graphics Definition
The term Computer Graphics describes any use of computers to create and manipulate images.

### 1.1 Graphics Areas

#### Major Areas  

* **Modeling**ï¼šModeling deals with the mathematical specification of shape and appearance properties in a way that can be stored on the computer.

* **Rendering**: Rendering is a term inherited from art and deals with the creation of shaded images from 3D computer models.

* **Animation**: Animation is a technique to create an illusion of motion through sequences of images. Animation uses modeling and rendering but adds the key issue of movement over time, which is not usually dealt with in basic modeling and rendering.
